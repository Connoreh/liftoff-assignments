## Submission Instructions

### Overview

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn more about the APIs involved in bringing in the databases of collectables. Also need to learn if there will be any complications with lending/renting out items. We are using a familiar tech stack for most of the work, so ideally would like to add a new technology to learn while improving on the others.
